# Desktop TV

Very simple Python desktop sharing solution.
My usecase: sharing screen separately from audio/video (for which phone is good enough).

## Dev Installation/Usage
Requires Python 3.10

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roma-guru/desktop-tv
cd desktop-tv
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```
