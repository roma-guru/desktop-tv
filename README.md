# Desktop TV

Very simple Python desktop sharing solution.
My usecase: sharing screen separately from audio/video (for which phone is good enough).

## Dev Installation/Usage
Requires Python >=3.10 and ngrok binary in PATH.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roma-guru/desktop-tv
cd desktop-tv
python -m venv .venv
./run.sh [opt_ngrok_domain]
```
